# Windowed_analyses
Windowed_analysis_no_conversion_ohta_version.R #Script to assign sex-linkage status to SNPs from different datasets and join them together into a single SNP file; that SNP file is then converted to LG positions using the python script SNP_list_Interactive_Chromonomer_LG_position_switcher.py. Sum and mean counts for different window sizes can then be generated using this R script.

Windowing_genome_content.R #Script for windowed analyses of gene and repeat content

bedtools_snp_counts_GBS_data.txt #Script to collect SNP counts in windows from population GBS dataset using bedtools
